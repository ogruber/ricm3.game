# Task1 - Shapes

We discuss in the classroom the design of shapes in an object-oriented programming language like Java. We will consider three shapes:

  - Points
  - Lines
  - Polygons

## Class Point

In the Java package "object.graph.shapes", please create a class named "Point".

### Point Fields

A point is defined by two coordinates (x,y), so define two fields in the class "Point", named "x" and "y", and containing values that are float values (one of the primitive values of Java for real numbers).

### Point Constructors

Please define the following three public constructors:

- A constructor with no argument.
- A constructor with two coordinates (x,y) as float values.
- A constructor with a given point.

```java
class Point {
  float x,y;
  Point() {}
  }
```

### Point Methods

Please define the following public methods:
